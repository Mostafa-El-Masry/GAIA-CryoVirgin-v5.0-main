          "Mechanical-to-electrical: early computers used punched cards inspired by the Jacquard loom to feed instructions. Those cards led to low-level assembly languages that talked almost directly to hardware.",
          "High-level languages arrived to make humans productive: FORTRAN and COBOL in the 1950s for math and business, then C in the 1970s, which still shapes modern languages like C++, Go, and Rust.",
          "UNIX and C spread the idea of portable software. Write code once, recompile on new hardware, and carry your logic with you. That portability mindset still powers cloud and container work today.",
          "The personal-computer era (1970s-80s) and the internet (1990s) exploded the need for accessible languages. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript emerged so people could publish and interact on the web.",
